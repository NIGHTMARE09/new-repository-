For context, this story takes place recently on September 28th 1918. So, I’m a normal soldier in the British army, (M27) and I’m fighting in the French village of Marcoing against the German army. I serve in the 5th Duke of Wellington’s Regiment by the way.

Anyways, in my line of fire is a man with a very weird kinda small mustache, and he seems wounded. He didn’t even bother to shoot me. He seemed like he was gonna die in a matter of minutes anyway so I was like you know what? Why not let him go. Anyways, he nodded thanks and walked off.

However about 21 years later I’m watching my television as I just repaired it, and I see some army of people with a weird wavy symbol they wear on their arms or something. And then I realize their leader has the same mustache and face as the guy I spared! That’s so WACKY!

Anyways there’s some kind of second Great War coming up because the mustache man I spared is invading something I don’t know it’s probably nothing.
